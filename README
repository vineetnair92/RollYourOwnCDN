Design Desicions:
DNS Server:
-- A multi-threaded DNS Server that serves a random replica server the first time it encounters a client and then assigns a replica
   server once it gets results from active measurements.
-- UDP server that translates the given host name with an IP address in the answer section. Sends a blank answer if the name requested
   was not the given host name.

HTTP Server:
-- Cache Eviction policy was chosen as Least Frequently Used (LFU) in order to take advantage of the Zipf distribution followed by
   web requests.
-- A multi-threaded web server where access to the common cache is synchronized by a mutex lock, so that the service can be parallelized to
   a certain extent.
-- A daemon thread that periodically persists the cache to the disk to insulate the web service from synchronous writes to disk.

Strategy: Active Measurements
-- The DNS server broadcasts its client IPs to all the replica servers, each of which then use scamper pings and return the results back to
   the DNS server.
-- The DNS server then updates its table with ping values that are lower than the current value.
-- Uses two additional ports on the DNS server and each of the replicas to communicate this information. The ports are selected
   as a function of the port number to the servers. This was done to simplify the handling of communication for active measurement.
   
What we would do with more time:
-- We currently do not keep track of load on each server or implement load balancing. Eg. Keep track of how many IPs have been mapped to each
   replica server and for a new client, when two servers produce 'close' ping times, the one with the lesser load would be assigned.
